    <h3>How do I upload my data?</h3>
    <p>Choose your file. Pick your file format. Press Upload New Dataset. 
        Wait a few mins then refresh the page and you should see it in pick Dataset options.</p>

    <h3>What is the expected file format?</h3>
    <p>Gustavo's format accepts .fa.sorted.annot.gaps.category files. Please ensure your file has no headers or other errors in it before uploading.</p>
    <p>Bob's file format accepts his .tile.counts output file as is</p>

    <h3>I uploaded my file and can see it in the drop down but the vis isnt loading.</h3>
    <p>There was likely an error in converting your file to the vis file format. Most often this error occurs if one of the required values is null. Comb through your file to make sure there are no obvious mistakes. Let Aidan know and I can try and debug as well.</p>
